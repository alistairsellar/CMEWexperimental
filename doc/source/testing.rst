Testing in |CMEW| can be done in one of two ways. Acceptance tests which run
in the ``compare`` task verify if the correct outputs are produced by the workflow.
Unit tests which are run inside the ``unittest`` task run ``pytest`` over
existing python scripts in the workflow.

For a local try-change-validate loop, run unit tests with ``pytest`` before
submitting the full workflow:

1. ``module load scitools/community/esmvaltool/2.13.0``
2. ``pytest CMEW/app/unittest/tests``
3. ``cylc vip -n CMEWexperimental -O metoffice -O test``

You can run both steps in order with:
    ``./scripts/try-change-validate.sh``

To run the full |CMEW| workflow at the Met Office, with all tests enabled, use the command
    ``cylc vip -O metoffice -O test``

To only run the unit tests at the Met Office, use the command
    ``cylc vip -O metoffice -O unittest``
